This project is a comparison of **machine learning algorithms** for making predictions written in **Python (v3.7)** and using a built-in dataset included with **scikit-learn**. **Data visualizations** are also included.

This repository contains new feature development continued from the [**Jupyter** version](https://github.com/hfagerlund/machine-learning-iris-analysis).
